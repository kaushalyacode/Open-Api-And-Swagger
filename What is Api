What is API
- are mechanisams
- enables two software components to communicate with each other using set of definitions and protocols.
  ex :weather bureau has weather data.Myweather mobile app takes weather data from weather bureauo via api and show those data in phone.
- API stands for APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE.
-APPLICATION - any software with distinct function
-INTERFACE - contract of service between two application.contract defines how the two communicate with
each other using request and responses.
-their API documentation contain information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.
============================================================================================================
We can use client server architecture to explain how api works.
application sending request is client.(mobile app)
and application sending the response is server.(bureaus weather db)

based on reson for create api and when, there are four ways API can work.
1. SOAP API - API use simple Object access protocall.Client and server exchange message using xml.less flexible.
2. RCP API- Remote procedure calls API.The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server , and the server sends the output back to client.
3. Websocket API - use json objects to pass data.support two way communication between client app and server.
4. Rest API
